This error occurs when you are using a library that expects a specific type of data, but you are providing it with something different. For example, if you are using a library that expects an array of objects, but you are providing it with an array of strings, you will get this error.  Another common cause is using incorrect prop types in a component. 
```javascript
// Incorrect prop type
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  data: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

// Correct prop type
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  data: PropTypes.array.isRequired,
};
```
