# React Native Unexpected Type Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: the unexpected type error. This error arises when a component or library receives data of an unexpected type, causing the application to crash or behave unpredictably.

## Problem
The `UnexpectedTypeError.js` file showcases a scenario where a component expects an array of objects but receives an array of strings. This mismatch in expected and actual data types leads to a runtime error.

## Solution
The `UnexpectedTypeErrorSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution.  By carefully checking data types and using appropriate type checking mechanisms such as PropTypes (or TypeScript), this error can be prevented.  The solution involves ensuring that the data passed to the component is of the correct type before it is used.
